# Solar Power Forecasting

## Skills Exhibited: Python, Data Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, Machine Learning, LSTM

In this project, I have used different methods to forecast the power production of solar panels.   
Below are the methods that I have used:   
- Moving Average
- Exponential Smoothing
- ARIMA
- Machine Learning
- LSTM

This data has been collected from the solar panels installed on the roof and daily readings of the power production have been recorded from October 2011 to November 2020.
